# nodeJS custom http-server
**This is currently just a passion project for my house**
Dont expect anything magical ok

#### When the server is **up**, you can check it out by visiting radiuk.ca/server

### TODO: 
1) Find an appropraite CSS framework to make it look decent
2) Organize and layout the main page listing
3) Come up with a way to distribute index files for sub directories
4) Get a SSL certificate (need SSH compatability too) so I can finally use https
5) Make the site public facing, add https and username/password or whitelisting
6) Once I'm happy with it, create a batch script to automate everything
7) Share with family and friends
